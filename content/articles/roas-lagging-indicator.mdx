## The month Kaaya almost scaled into a loss

Kaaya Skin — a D2C skincare brand doing ₹2Cr/month in revenue — had a ROAS of 3.8x. By most dashboards, things looked healthy. So the founder doubled ad spend in Q3, chasing the number up.

Six weeks later, the brand had burned through an additional ₹40L in media budget. ROAS had actually **climbed to 4.1x** on paper. And yet, net profit had compressed. Customer service tickets were up. Repeat purchases were flat.

What happened? ROAS was measuring revenue against ad spend — but it had no view into *who* was being acquired. The scaling had pulled in deal-hunters via discount-heavy creatives. High first-order value. Near-zero chance of repeat.

> **The core problem:** ROAS is a rear-view mirror. It reflects the quality of decisions you *already* made — not the quality of customers you're building a business on.

## Lagging vs. leading — what's the actual difference?

A **lagging indicator** confirms a trend after it's happened. It's useful for reporting, not decision-making. ROAS, revenue, and MoM growth all live here.

A **leading indicator** predicts where things are heading. It gives you a window to act before the outcome crystallises. nCAC and LTV — tracked by cohort — are leading indicators.

## nCAC × LTV — your new compass

The metric I actually optimise to is the **LTV:nCAC ratio**. For a D2C brand with a 12-month LTV window, you want this ratio at 3x or above. Below 2x, you're buying revenue at cost.

The key word is *new* customers. Most brands calculate CAC against all orders — including repeat purchases — which artificially deflates the number and makes acquisition look cheaper than it is.

```
# The core ratio
LTV : nCAC ratio = 12-month LTV ÷ Net CAC

# Net CAC = what it truly costs to acquire one NEW customer
nCAC = (Ad Spend + Agency Fees + Creative Costs)
       ÷ New Customers ONLY (not total orders)

# D2C benchmarks
LTV:nCAC > 3x  → Healthy. Safe to scale.
LTV:nCAC 2–3x  → Borderline. Fix before scaling.
LTV:nCAC < 2x  → Stop. You're buying revenue at a loss.
```

## How Kaaya's cohorts told the real story

When we went back into the data, we split Kaaya's customers by acquisition channel and month — not by total revenue. Two things became immediately visible.

Both cohorts had similar first-order AOVs. ROAS couldn't tell them apart. But their 30-day repeat behaviour diverged by nearly 3x — which meant their actual LTV was incomparable.

<CohortVisualiser />

> A 4.1x ROAS built on 1.6x LTV:nCAC customers isn't a performance win. It's a margin leak dressed up as growth.

## What changed when they switched frameworks

Three months after the switch, Kaaya cut total ad spend by 18% — and grew net profit by 31%. Not because they spent less. Because they **stopped spending on the wrong customers**.

The before/after was simple: stop optimising creative for first-order conversion, and start optimising for repeat intent — reviews, rituals, education. Scale only the channels where LTV:nCAC clears 3x. Track nCAC weekly on new customers only.

## How to start tracking this tomorrow

You don't need a data team. You need three columns in a spreadsheet and one discipline: **separate new customers from returning customers** in every report you build.

```
# Weekly nCAC tracker — minimum viable version

Column A: Week ending date
Column B: Total spend (ads + agency + creative production)
Column C: New customer orders ONLY (first purchase, no repeats)
Column D: nCAC = B ÷ C

# Track the 30-day repeat rate for every weekly cohort
Column E: % of Column C who reordered within 30 days

# Your alarm bell
If nCAC rises AND 30-day repeat drops → stop scaling immediately.
```

Most Shopify and WooCommerce stores can pull new-vs-returning customer splits natively. If you're running Meta or Google, segment your purchase events by new customer tags. It takes 30 minutes to set up. It takes a ROAS-only mindset *six weeks* to find the problem it creates.

> **The takeaway:** ROAS tells you whether yesterday's bet paid off. nCAC:LTV tells you whether tomorrow's is worth making. Run both — but optimise to the one that gives you time to act.
